### **Purpose of MentorMe**

The project explores how a web based application can be used within a mentoring environment. There are currently a range of options available to allow students to contact potential mentors, however none of them are explicitly for that reason. As the number of graduate jobs continue to increase within new sectors such as technology, graduates remain to have difficulties finding employment or knowing what they want to do. The result of this being companies are receiving poor quality applications which are not tailored to the job. Furthermore, the aim was to investigate how this can be improved through mentorship and was it found beneficial with 90.4% percent stating that they found it to be so. 

An investigation was conducted into whether or not students and mentors would find a one-to-one communication web platform to be beneficial. A variety of different research techniques have been carried out by exploring and addressing the shortcomings of the current solutions and options in order to demonstrate the proposes and necessity for such application. One being a questionnaire study, which was conducted for both students and potential mentors to understand potential benefits, as well as expectations of the system. With additional research also being carried out via meetings with a careers advisor and also other students. 

The findings of the research can be linked to the platform which was built using the MEAN stack. Each feature included facilitates the limitations of current options, including allowing students to seek mentorship and advice. Mentors will gain from the ability of finding new talent and also the gratification of helping others. Various core features where identified which included messaging, finding a mentor, questions, a profile and the ability to search and have been implemented into Mentor.Me along with additional functionality. 

Overall the project has produced a positive outcome, which can be gathered from the students and mentorâ€™s questionnaire results of the completed project. With 100% percent stating that they would recommend Mentor.Me and many stating how this is going to be beneficial for them.
